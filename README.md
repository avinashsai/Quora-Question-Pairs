This is my solution to this competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs on kaggle. I have tried couple of models which includes the following. I will be adding all the approaches sequentially. 


**Manhattan LSTM Model** (Train Accuracy - 85% ,Train loss - 0.1, Validation Accuracy - 80%, Validation Loss - 0.14)

**Siamese 2 hidden LSTM Layers with 3 Dense Layers**(Train-Accuracy - 86%,Train-loss- 0.31 Validation-Accuracy - 82%,Validation-Loss- 0.4)

**Siamese Dense model with 3 Dense Layers** (Train-Accuracy - 88%,Train-loss- 0.29)
